### Hi there folks ðŸ‘‹


I am a recent graduate with second class honours from Open University in Computing and IT (Software Programming). I am a mature individual with exceptional self-discipline able to undertake complex problem solving tasks effectively as both part of a team and on my own. My completed course had a strong focus on object-orientated software development within an Agile working environment and specific workings with JAVA, Python, SQL and PHP. Due to the distance learning nature of the course, my skill-set has been honed to work within the difficult atmosphere that remote working possesses. I am very interested in the technology sector as a whole but my particular area of interest lies in blockchain technology, IoT, cryptography and the solutions it can be provide. In my spare time I enjoy working with small electronic projects using Raspberry Pis, bread-boards and Arduino chips as well as playing guitar, bass and piano. 

I am very interested in the developing world of blockchain technology and the real world solutions it can provide. I am particularly interested in the area's of self-sovereign identity and being able to control your own privacy through this.

My GitHub currently contains some examples of my work as well as tutorials and methods I have used whilst studying. I am currently transferring a lot my old project work from other saves.


 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - C# and building simple blockchains with Python and JAVA.
 
 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working through implementations of simple blockchains using various languages.
