### Hi there folks ðŸ‘‹


I am a recent graduate with second class honours from Open University in Computing and IT (Software Programming). My completed course had a strong focus on object-orientated software development within an Agile working environment and specific workings with JAVA, Python, SQL and PHP. I am very interested in the technology sector as a whole but my particular area of interest lies in blockchain technology, IoT, cryptography and the solutions it can be provide. 

I am very interested in the developing world of blockchain technology and the real world solutions it can provide. I am particularly interested in the area's of self-sovereign identity and being able to control your own privacy through this. I enjoy building some hobby projects and hope to contribute more of these as time goes on.

 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - C# and building simple blockchains with Python and JAVA.
 
 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working through implementations of simple blockchains using various languages.
