### Hi there folks ðŸ‘‹
I am a Computing and IT student who specialised in Software Programming. I have recently graduated and I am currently in search of a job within the IT sector. My GitHub currently contains some examples of my projects as well as tutorials and various methods I used whilst studying. I will be consistently updating these.
